These changes to CW3 are optimized for my use. Some stuff is deleted.

Optimized for:
12 months over 2 pages, small designs, metric units, a few other tweaks


Optimized for small designs, I've tried to make dates wrap instead of split for some months.

Original was GPL so this is too. https://sourceforge.net/projects/calendarwizard/
