These changes to CW3 are optimized for my use. Some stuff is deleted.

It's optimized for a feature-rich calendar in a very small space, with a lot of hardcoded/changed options/defaults, so this is probably not for you, but it may serve as a practical API in-use example.

Original was GPL so this is too. https://sourceforge.net/projects/calendarwizard/
